# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to JSONEditor.

## Before You Start

- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a duplicate.
- Open an issue before making a large behavioral or architectural change.
- Never include real credentials, tokens, private keys, or sensitive JSON in
  issues, screenshots, tests, or commits.

## Local Setup

Requirements:

- Node.js 22 (the CI version)
- npm

Install the locked dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Making Changes

Browse [help wanted issues](https://github.com/shubhamashish33/json-comparator/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22).
Comment with your approach to coordinate with other contributors. Fork and
clone the repository, create a focused branch, and open your pull request
against `main`. Use `Closes #123` to link a resolved issue.

Open http://localhost:3000 after starting the dev server. Local JSON editing
and comparison require no backend or credentials.

### Project Map

- `src/JSONCompare.js`: workspaces, comparison UI, and state management.
- `src/jsonUtils.js`: parsing, repair, comparison, paths, redaction, and exports.
- `src/jsonUtils.test.js`: utility regression tests.
- `src/jsonWorker.js`: background parsing, indexing, search, and comparison.
- `src/HelpPage.js`: user-facing workflow documentation.
- `src/index.css`: application styles.

Follow the [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and report
vulnerabilities through the [Security Policy](.github/SECURITY.md).

### Change Guidelines

- Keep changes focused on one problem.
- Follow the existing React and utility patterns.
- Preserve browser-local processing and privacy behavior.
- Add or update tests when changing JSON parsing, comparison, querying,
  transformation, or redaction logic.
- Update the README and Help page when user-facing behavior changes.

## Verification

Run both commands before submitting a pull request:

```bash
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false --runInBand
CI=true npm run build
```

Use `npm test` for interactive testing. For bug fixes, add a regression test
that fails before the fix and passes afterward. Manually check the affected
workspace: utility tests do not exercise Monaco or worker/UI interactions.
Include actual check results and anything you could not verify in your PR.

## Pull Requests

- Explain the problem and the implemented solution.
- Link the related issue when one exists.
- Include screenshots for visible UI changes.
- Describe how the change was tested.
- Keep unrelated formatting or refactoring out of the pull request.
